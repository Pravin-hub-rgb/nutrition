                    <p>
                        From a scientific standpoint whether you gain weight or lose weight is determined by first law of <b>thermodynamics</b> which states that,
                        <b>The energy cannot be created or be destroyed, it can only be transformed from one type to another.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Your body weight does depend only on the difference between the amount of calorie balance.</p>
                    <div class="dark">
                        <h3>Q&rarr; What is a Calorie?</h3>
                        <p>
                            A&rarr; Energy needed to raise the temprature of 1 litre of water by 1 degree celsius. <br> That means a calorie is a form of energy measurements
                            <br>
                            <b>A calorie = form of energy measurement.</b>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>When you eat your food you're consuming the energy that is stored within the food, then this energy is used to produce movements and keeps your organs alive, the access energy can be stored for later use (as glycogen or fat) some energy
                        can be stored in the muscles and liver as glycogen but these stores fill up pretty quick so, your body will then store any additional calories in the form of body fat.
                    </p>
                    <div class="dark">
                        <div class="content-heading">

                            <h3>1- Negative Calorie Balance</h3>
                            <p>This occurs when someone burns more calories than he/she consumes. Negative calorie balance always reuslts to weight loss.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="light">
                            <h3>2- Neutral Calorie Balance</h3>
                            <p>Here a person's intake is the same as the expenditure of activities and body processes. Here the body weight remains the same.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="light">
                            <h3>3- Positive Calorie Balance</h3>
                            <p>More energy is consumed through fuel and being burned to produce body processes or movement. In this case calories are stored as either glycogen in the liver or as fat.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Your calorie balance will determine how much muscles you can gain and how much fat you can loose over any period of time because calories are literally the building blocks of body tissue. <br> If you want to build muscles you not
                            only need to train but you also need to provide your body with necessary raw materials to form muscles cells. On the other ahnd if you want to burn fat you have to make sure that not enough calories are shoveled into fat cells
                            to keep them to same size</p>

                                    clogged or blocked arteries. Therefor a high LDL cholesterol can theoratically put you at rist for heart attack stroke and other major health problems. Nowadays the effect of saturated fats and LDL cholesterol seems
                                    to be al lot less problematic than previously and the debate whether saturated fat directly increses your risk of heart problems is still unsettled. <br> But it's probably best to limit foods that are high in saturated
                                    fats. <br> Foods that contains a lot of saturated fat are animal product such as butter cheese, whole milk, ice cream and fatty meals. Some vegetable oil such as coconut contains saturated fats. Saturated fats are solid

                        <p>Combining carb with different food like dietary fat, slows down the pace of digestion and therefore lowers its impact on blood sugar levels.</p>

                            Simple rule: If you are eating whole, unprocessed carbs, considere them as good, but if the carb has been proceesssed it's a 'bad' carbs. <br> such as soda, white bread.

                            <p>Studies done with endurance runners and vegetarians, that diet is very high in carbs can be healthy in the long term. <br> What assumes though is that you get your carbs form quality sources such as rice, quinoa oats and potatoes.
                                <br> These all are complex carbs that do not lead to a sudden spike in insulin levels which is the case for simpole carbs like candy and sugar.</p>

                            Fat timing is very simple.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The only time you should avoid fat is right before your workout, since fat slows down the digestion of both carbs and protein. <br> <br> Don't over complicate this though as long as you meet your recommended daily fat intake.
                            <br>This is the least important thing to worry about.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fat intake right before you work will not only make you feel more tired. It also limits the availabiliy of energy in the form of carbs throughout your workout.

                            In a scientific sense it's meant to do three things:

                            <br>&rarr; Reduce muscle protein breakdown.

                            Now how you accomplish this. <br> Easy you eat carbs and protein before your workout.
                            <br>What this means is that most important rule of your pre-workout meal is to consume a good amount of both carbs and protein before your workout.

                            Even though you don't have to use protein powder to reach your recommended daily intake, consuming enough protein every day can be tricky. <br> It most likely won't matter all that much which kind of protein you buy as long

                                There are two forms of protein that are not recommended to beginners. <br>
                                <span class="imp">1- Beef protein powder&rarr;</span> It's best source of protein but the fact that most of the time you aren't getting the real thing. Many beef protein powder is made from what is left after you take away
                                the quality meat. This includes the ligaments, joints and even ears.

                                <br>Overall it seems that as long as you meet your daily calorie and nutritional requirements through your normal diet it doesn't matter when you drink you protein shake.

                            <p>
                                Creatine is an organic acid that helps supply the muscle cells with energy during high-intensity, short-duration exercise. <br> Even though it is a non essential nutrient, because our body can produce creatine naturally,
                                supplementation makes sense as it will further improve performance.
                                <br> Creatine helps produce ATP more quickly which is the primary energy molecule used during weight training.
                                <br> Faster ATP availability translate to more strength which in turn means more lean muscle gains over time. Along with increased strength creatine will cause more water retention in the muscle which makes them appear
                                bigger and fuller.

                            <p>Creatine monohydrate is the most effective form of creatine while variations like <i>Kre Alkalyn (=buffered creatine)</i> or <i> creatine ethyl ester</i> are ofter sold for more than double the normal price, scientific studies
                                showed no additional benefits.</p>

                            They want to make you believe that there effects are due to newest discovery in nutrition research or some king of increase in testosterone but in reality and in 99% of the cases the boost comes from caffeine.
                            <br>The heavy lifting is almost always done by caffeine. Virtually all pre-workout supplements contains around 100 to 300 milligrams of caffeine in each serving.
                            <br>This by itself is nothing bad ofcourse as long as you don't overdose. Caffiene is a safe supplement but you don't need to pay high price for a supplement to get it.
                            <br> This is why most of the mainstream pre-workout products are a waste of money.
                            <br>You will save a lot of money if you simply buy caffeine and may be L-Tyrosine separately and take both 30 to 45 minutes before your workout <br> (100-200 mg caffeine and 1000 -3000 mg of L-Tyrosine).
